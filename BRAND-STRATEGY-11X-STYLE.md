## The Team (11x Style — Named AI Workers)

Comme 11x a **Alice** (SDR) et **Julian** (Phone), Orchestra a:

| Worker | Role | Personality |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Ludo** | Founder & Visionary | Human. Strategy, clients, vision |
| **Alba** | Chief Strategy Officer | AI. Business intelligence, market analysis, planning |
| **Lea** | Lead Engineer | AI. Full-stack development, architecture, shipping |

**Messaging:**
> "Meet the team. One human founder. Two AI executives. Unlimited output."

---

## Visual Identity — 11x Clean

### Color Palette

**11x uses a very clean, almost monochrome palette with subtle accents.**

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Black** | `#000000` | Primary background |
| **Off-Black** | `#0A0A0A` | Secondary background |
| **White** | `#FFFFFF` | Primary text |
| **Gray** | `#888888` | Secondary text |
| **Light Gray** | `#E5E5E5` | Borders, dividers |
| **Accent** | `#6366F1` | CTAs, links, highlights (Indigo) |

**Simplified for Orchestra:**

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Void** | `#000000` | Background |
| **Surface** | `#111111` | Cards, elevated elements |
| **White** | `#FFFFFF` | Headlines, primary text |
| **Muted** | `#71717A` | Secondary text |
| **Border** | `#27272A` | Subtle borders |
| **Accent** | `#8B5CF6` | Purple (Orchestra signature) |
| **Accent Hover** | `#A78BFA` | Lighter purple for hover |

### Typography

**11x uses clean, modern sans-serif. No fancy display fonts.**

**Orchestra:**
- **Headlines**: Inter Bold (or Geist)
- **Body**: Inter Regular
- **That's it.** Clean and simple.

### Type Scale

| Level | Size | Weight |
|-------|------|--------|
| H1 | 56px | 600 |
| H2 | 40px | 600 |
| H3 | 28px | 600 |
| Body | 18px | 400 |
| Small | 14px | 400 |

### Logo

**Minimal. Wordmark-focused.**

- "ORCHESTRA" in Inter Bold or custom geometric sans
- Simple symbol: Abstract "O" with neural network hint
- Works perfectly in single color

## Messaging — 11x Direct Style

### Hero Section

**11x Hero**: "Digital workers, Human results"

**Orchestra Hero:**
```
Intelligence that ships.

We're an AI-native SaaS studio. One human founder,
two AI executives, unlimited output.

From vision to product in 90 days.

[Book a call]  [See our work]
```

### Problem/Solution

**The Old Way:**
- 18 months to ship
- Agency delivers code, not strategy
- You manage the project
- Tech debt from day one

**The Orchestra Way:**
- 90 days to ship
- Strategy + Code + AI in one team
- We manage everything
- Production-ready architecture

## Website Structure (11x Simple)

```
/                   → Home (hero + workers + process + pricing + CTA)
/workers            → Meet the team (Ludo, Alba, Lea profiles)
/work               → Case studies (when available)
/pricing            → Detailed pricing
/contact            → Book a call
```

**Note**: 11x keeps it simple. Few pages, clear navigation. No blog at launch.

## Design Principles (11x Style)

1. **Less is more** — Every element earns its place
2. **White space is confidence** — Don't fill every pixel
3. **Typography does the heavy lifting** — No decorative elements
4. **Dark mode default** — Premium, modern, easy on eyes
5. **Subtle animations only** — Fade-ins, no flashy effects
6. **Mobile-first** — Most visits are mobile

---

## Copy Guidelines

### Do:
- Be direct. "We build SaaS" not "We empower organizations to..."
- Use "you" and "your"
- Short sentences
- Specific numbers (90 days, not "fast")
- Active voice

### Don't:
- Corporate jargon
- Buzzwords without substance
- Long paragraphs
- Passive voice
- Exclamation marks (mostly)

### Examples:

❌ "We leverage cutting-edge AI technologies to deliver best-in-class solutions that empower your business to achieve unprecedented growth!"

✅ "We build SaaS products with AI. In 90 days. That's it."

---

## Social Media (11x Clean)

### LinkedIn Post Template

```
[Bold statement]

[2-3 lines of context]

[The insight/lesson]

[CTA or question]

---
Orchestra Intelligence
Intelligence that ships.
```

### Example Post:

```
Most agencies take 18 months to ship a SaaS.

We do it in 90 days.

Not because we cut corners. Because we have two AI executives
who work 24/7, don't need coffee breaks, and never forget context.

The future of software development isn't more developers.
It's smarter teams.

What's the longest project you've waited for?
